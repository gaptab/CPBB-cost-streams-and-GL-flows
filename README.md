CPBB (Consumer, Private, and Business Banking) Business &amp; Products from a cost perspective, youâ€™ll need to focus on analyzing cost streams, understanding systems used for booking, and tracing the General Ledger (GL) flow.

Cost Analysis:

Create a pivot table in Excel or use Python (pandas) to group data by Product and Cost Category.
Identify high-cost areas (e.g., marketing, fixed systems) and their contribution to the total.
GL Flow Visualization:

Plot the flow of transactions using a directed graph (e.g., in networkx in Python) to visualize debit and credit flows between accounts.
Trend Analysis:

Use visualization tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) to track cost trends over time.
Reconciliation:

Verify that total debits match total credits for all transactions to ensure the GL is balanced.
